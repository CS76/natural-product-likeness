### Natural Product Likeness

> Natural selection process optimises the small molecules (Natural products - NP's) for maximum interactions with the biological macro molecules. NPs are therefore an excellent source of validated substructures for the design of novel bioactive molecules. This project is an attempt to extract the features that characterise the natural products structural space and then employ this knowledge in developing machine-learning (ML)  based models to predict novel molecule's natural product likeliness. These ML-based models can then be used for designing new lead compounds or for screening compound libraries.
